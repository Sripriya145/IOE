Understood. You have a 3-pin Active Buzzer Module (VCC, I/O, GND).
Your code uses Pin 9 to control the buzzer.
So connect it like this:

Buzzer Module (3-Pin)
---------------------
VCC → 5V
I/O → D9  (buzzerPin)
GND → GND

LM35 Temperature Sensor
-----------------------
Pin 1 (left)  → 5V
Pin 2 (middle) → A0 (tempSensorPin)
Pin 3 (right) → GND


Complete Wiring:

Component	Pin	Connect To
LM35	Left pin	5V
LM35	Middle pin	A0
LM35	Right pin	GND
Buzzer Module	VCC	5V
Buzzer Module	I/O	Digital Pin 9
Buzzer Module	GND	GND

Note:
This buzzer is active, so when Pin 9 → HIGH, buzzer turns ON.
When Pin 9 → LOW, buzzer turns OFF.

Your code works perfectly with this connection.
